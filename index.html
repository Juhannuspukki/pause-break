    How to remap any key to pause break on Windows
  </h1>

  <h2>
    The problem
  </h2>
  <p>So, here we are. You purchased Homeworld 2 Remastered but cannot use the tactical pause on HW2 Classic. Why? Because the pause function is mapped to the pause/break key which few keyboards have. Yours certainly does not.</p>
  <p>Now what?</p>
  <h2>
    Solution that do not work so don't bother trying
  </h2>
  <p>You tried using the Windows on-screen keyboard to remap one of your Logitech mouse buttons to act as pause break. No cake. The command is interpreted as ctrl+insert and zooms in instead of pausing the game.</p>
  <p>Then you try SharpKeys. Turns out that it supports all keys with the exception of - you guessed it - pause break. The scan code for pause break key is E1 1D 45 E1 9D C5 which is apparently exceptionally complex and cannot be slapped on to Windows registry like the other key codes.</p>
  <h2>
    Solution that works
  </h2>
  <p>The problem is solved by installing AutoHotkey and running the following script:</p>
  <p>#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0</p>
  <p>NumpadAdd::Send "{Pause}"</p>
  <p>Those two lines are enough. After this the + button on numpad will act as pause.</p>
  <p>If needed, the NumpadAdd can be replaced with any button on the keyboard. F7 would replace it with the F7 key, for example.</p>
